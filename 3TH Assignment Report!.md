## Intruction
in this Assignment, we supposed to create an object-oriented Java program that can manage a library. The program should allow users to search for books, borrow and return books, and manage the library inventory and it should be designed using object-oriented programming principles.

## Design and Implementation
i tried to go with the template that has been given us , but in my opinion there was a lot of non-necessary usable methods amoung them. so i deleted some of them and tried to create an optimized program by using these concepts: encapsulation and inheritance !
maybe i overthinked about it, but im ok with that for now :)

## Testing and Evaluation
for the test process, in Main class, i tried to make a basic (but clean) graphical user interface just to notice the user how many options he have in our library !
